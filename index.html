        Born from the spirit of the California coast and the craft of 1980s programming,  
        Blue Coast Software is a small workshop dedicated to lean, lasting, and carefully  
        designed software.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is our guild hall — where code, design, and story meet.  
        More projects will be revealed as the tide rolls on.
